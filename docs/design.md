# Design

## Architecture

Rings is an implementation of MTG and a parachain of Mixin network.

#### Mixin MTG struct

![](images/mixin_mtg_struct.png)


#### MTG system data flow
* The user transfers a payment(UTXO) that carries business data to the Mixin network.
* Rings syncs the outputs(UTXO) by parsing the business data(in output.memo)
* Rings dispatchs the business action(included in business data) and processes each action(supply, borrow...)

![](images/workflow.png)

In MTG system, There are two main roles, one is `Payee`, and the another is `cashier`, All business logic is implemented based on these two roles.

* `Payee` receiving the outputs(transactions), decoding the business data from `Output.Memo`, dispatching `actions`
![](images/f_payee.png)

* `cashier` spending the token, transfering the token to user
![](images/f_cashier.png)

#### Rings actions

* `Supply`, Suppose users supply the underlying token `ETH` and gain the equity token `cETH`
  ![](images/tl_supply.png)

* `Pledge`, Suppose users pledge the equity token `cETH`, meains that users should pay `cETH` to the Rings system
  ![](images/tl_pledge.png)

* `Unpledge`, Suppose users unpledge the equity token `cETH`, meains that users should pay some gas `CNB` and will get the equity token `cETH` back
  ![](images/tl_unpledge.png)

* `Redeem`, Suppose users redeem the underlying token `ETH` from the system, means that users should pay equity token `cETH` and whill get the quivalent underlying token `ETH` back
  ![](images/tl_redeem.png)

* `Borrow`, Suppose users need to borrow the underlying token `USDT`, means that users should pay some gas `CNB` and will gain the expected underlying token `USDT`
  ![](images/tl_borrow.png)

* `Repay`, Suppose users repay `USDT`, means that users pay `USDT` and the users' debt will be reduced
  ![](images/tl_repay.png)

* `quick_pledge`, Suppose users supply the underlying token `ETH` and no equity token `cETH` returns to users
  ![](images/tl_quick_pledge.png)
* `qick_redeem`, Suppose users redeem `ETH`, users only pay some gas `CNB`, and will get the underlying token `ETH` back
  ![](images/tl_quick_redeem.png)
* `quick_borrow`, Suppose users can supply `ETH` or `cETH` and can borrow `USDT` directory
  ![](images/tl_quick_borrow.png)
  

* `Liquidation`, Suppose User A has Pledged `ETH` and Borrowed `USDT`, once The liquidity of user A's account less than or equal zero, it can be liquidated by other users
  ![](images/tl_liquidation.png)

* `Proposal actions`, all governance work produces effects through proposal voting, the current proposals include these: 
    1. `market` for creating market or updating market
    2. `open-market` for opening market
    3. `close-market` for closing market
    4. `allowlist` whether to allow liquidation
    5. `add-oracle-signer` add the price oracle signer that provides market price
    6. `rm-oracle-signer` remove the price oracle signer
    7. `withdraw` withdraw the reserves from the market

```

#### [Rest APIs](../handler/rest/rest.go) exported for application layer, including:

```
/markets/all   //response all markets
/transactions  //response compound transactions
/price-requests // for price oracle calling
```

#### Worker
* [cashier](../worker/cashier/cashier.go) Processes the pending transfers. prepare for transfering a transaction to Mixin network.
* [syncer](../worker/syncer/syncer.go) Syncs the outputs(UTXO) from Mixin network.
* [txsender](../worker/txsender/sender.go) Transfers raw transaction to Mixin network.
* [spentsync](../worker/spentsync/spentsync.go) syncs and updates the transfer state.
* [priceoracle](../worker/priceoracle/priceoracle.go) Fetches a price and put the price on the chain.
* [payee](../worker/snapshot/payee.go) processes outputs and dispatches business actions.

#### Action processing
* [borrow](../worker/snapshot/borrow.go) handles the borrow action event.
* [supply](../worker/snapshot/supply.go) handles the supply action event.
* [pledge](../worker/snapshot/supply_pledge.go) handles the pledge action event.
* [unpledge](../worker/snapshot/supply_unpledge.go) handles the unpledge action event.
* [redeem](../worker/snapshot/supply_redeem.go) handles the redeem action event.
* [repay](../worker/snapshot/borrow_repay.go) handles the repay action event.
* [liquidation](../worker/snapshot/liquidation.go) handles the liquidation action event
* [proposal](../worker/snapshot/proposal.go) handles and dispatches the proposal actions, include: adding market, updating market, closing or opening market, adding or removing allowlist, withdraw
* [price](../worker/snapshot/price.go) handles the price protocal action event.


### Market Trade-Curbing Mechanism

> Close the market when the price of a certain market is abnormal.

* When the price of a market is maliciously attacked, managers have the right to execute the `close-market` order and apply for a closed-market vote. If the request is approved, the market will be closed.
* Trades are prohibited in closed markets.
* However, as long as there are closed markets, liquidation of all markets will be prohibited, because liquidation will affect the liquidity of all market accounts of users.

## The implementation of compound protocol 

* [Interest rate model](../internal/compound/interest_rate_model.go) is The core implementation of compound protocol.

* [Borrow balance](../core/borrow.go) user borrow balance contains borrow principal and borrow interest. `balance = borrow.principal * market.borrow_index / borrow.interest_index`

* [Accrue interest](../service/market/market.go) Accruing interest only occurs when there is a behavior that causes changes in market transaction data, such as supply, borrow, pledge, unpledge, redeem, repay, price updating. And Only calculated once in the same block.

```
	blockNumberPrior := market.BlockNumber

	blockNum, e := s.blockSrv.GetBlock(ctx, time)
	if e != nil {
		return e
	}

	blockDelta := blockNum - blockNumberPrior
	if blockDelta > 0 {
		borrowRate, e := s.curBorrowRatePerBlockInternal(ctx, market)
		if e != nil {
			return e
		}

		if market.BorrowIndex.LessThanOrEqual(decimal.Zero) {
			market.BorrowIndex = borrowRate
		}

		timesBorrowRate := borrowRate.Mul(decimal.NewFromInt(blockDelta))
		interestAccumulated := market.TotalBorrows.Mul(timesBorrowRate)
		totalBorrowsNew := interestAccumulated.Add(market.TotalBorrows)
		totalReservesNew := interestAccumulated.Mul(market.ReserveFactor).Add(market.Reserves)
		borrowIndexNew := market.BorrowIndex.Add(timesBorrowRate.Mul(market.BorrowIndex))

		market.BlockNumber = blockNum
		market.TotalBorrows = totalBorrowsNew.Truncate(16)
		market.Reserves = totalReservesNew.Truncate(16)
		market.BorrowIndex = borrowIndexNew.Truncate(16)
	}
